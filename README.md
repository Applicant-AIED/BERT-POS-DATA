## BERT-POS:Sentiment Analysis of MOOC Reviews Based on BERT with Part-of-Speech Information

This library contains the training dataset and testing dataset used in the paper "BERT-POS: Sentiment Analysis of MOOC Reviews Based on BERT with Part-of-Speech Information"

The file structure of this library is as follows：


```
│ README.md
│
├─Semi-supervised
│ train_semi_supervised.tsv

```



`train_semi_supervised.tsv` serves as the supervised learning data set of this paper. It contains 11,314 comments, all of which are from [iCourse](http://www.icourse163.com) and are manually marked (we randomly selected 15,000 comments, and then extracted the comments with the same results from at least 4 annotators, and finally retained 11,314 comments).



`train_supervised.tsv` serves as the semi-supervised learning data set of this paper, It contains 17,393 comments, all of which are from [iCourse](http://www.icourse163.com). Among them, 30% of the data labels are manually marked and 70% of the data labels are generated by reinforcement learning.



`Test` folder contains testing dataset of three orders of magnitude. The testing dataset of each order of magnitude is divided into two versions, label version and no label version.
